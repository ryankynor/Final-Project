# Geostationary orbit calculator


This code will have the user enter the static mass of the rocket, mass of fuel of the rocket, and exhaust velocity of the rocket used. Using these parameters it will calculate if the rocket would make it into a geostationary orbit. The user will be able to access the project from github.com and run it in runpython.com. The program will only respond to keyboard inputs, all mouse inputs will be ignored
